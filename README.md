## Features

- **Work in the terminal:** stream assistant responses alongside tool activity in a persistent conversation.
- **Understand and change code:** search and read project files, make edits, and run shell commands through configurable permission modes.
- **Choose your model:** use supported built-in providers or define custom models; adjust thinking depth per request.
- **Extend the workflow:** load repository guidance, Skills, MCP servers, and Microcode plugins.
- **Pick up where you left off:** save sessions locally, resume them with rendered conversation history, and scroll through long runs.
- **Handle Git interactively:** inspect changes, manage branches and staging, commit, fetch, pull, push, and work with stashes.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.14 or later to develop and build from source.
- A terminal with Unicode support. Some TUI interactions, including mouse-wheel scrolling, depend on terminal mouse-reporting support.

## Quick start

Build and install from a repository checkout:

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```

The build creates a standalone executable and installs it to:

| Platform | Install path |
|---|---|
| Linux / macOS | `~/.local/bin/microcode` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\microcode\bin\microcode.exe` |

On Windows, add `%LOCALAPPDATA%\microcode\bin` to `PATH` if the build reports that the command is not available in your current shell. The executable has no Bun runtime dependency.

To run directly from source while developing:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Run tests with `bun test ./tests`.

To launch Microcode in the project you want to work on, first change to that project's directory, then run `microcode`.

### Development setup

For local development, clone the repository and install the locked dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/milo-ally/microcode.git
cd microcode
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev
```

Set the API key for your chosen provider in the environment, or use `/login` after starting the TUI. Run `bun test ./tests` before submitting changes; `bun run build` also verifies the standalone build and installs it to the user-level bin directory.

After installing, launch Microcode from the project you want to work on:

```bash
microcode                         # Start in the current directory
microcode --resume                # Resume the latest session for this directory
microcode --resume abc12345       # Resume a session by ID prefix
microcode --model openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna
microcode --permission plan
microcode --thinking high
microcode --help
```

Other non-interactive commands:

```bash
microcode model list
microcode mcp list                 # List configured servers
microcode mcp list --scope project # Filter by scope: user, project, or all
microcode --version
```

## TUI input

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| `/` | Browse slash commands; choose actions from the on-screen list |
| `$` | Find a Skill as soon as the character is typed; `$skill-name` includes its instructions in the request |
| `@` | Search for and attach workspace files to a request |
| `#` | Find an enabled plugin and include its description and invocable Skill guidance |
| `! command` | Run a shell command and show its output in the conversation |
| `!! command` | Run a shell command without adding its output to the Agent context |
| `Ctrl+V` / `Shift+Insert` | Attach an image from the clipboard when supported by the terminal and model |

Autocomplete menus appear above the input. While viewing older conversation history, use the mouse wheel or PageUp/PageDown to scroll continuously; select **Return to bottom** to follow the latest output again. The input and footer stay anchored while chat output grows.

## Slash commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Show commands and keyboard shortcuts |
| `/clear` | Clear the current conversation view and Agent context |
| `/new` | Start a new conversation session |
| `/session` | Browse and load saved sessions |
| `/compact [instructions]` | Compress conversation context |
| `/export` | Export the current conversation as JSONL into `.microcode/` |
| `/status` | Show context usage, token statistics, and model details |
| `/model [provider/model]` | Browse, select, or switch models |
| `/thinking [level]` | Show or set thinking depth |
| `/permission [mode]` | Show or set the permission mode |
| `/login [provider]` | Sign in to a provider using the available authentication options |
| `/logout [provider]` | Sign out of a provider |
| `/auth` | Show provider authentication status |
| `/mcp` | Show MCP server status |
| `/skills` | Browse and manage Skills |
| `/plugins` | Browse plugins and enable or disable them by scope |
| `/git [action]` | Open the Git action menu or run a supported Git action |
| `/tasks` | Browse task lists and prioritize unfinished work in this session |
| `/instructions [reload]` | Show loaded project instructions or reload them |
| `/init` | Analyze the project and propose a `MICRO.md` project guide for review |
| `/exit` | Exit Microcode |

`/git` supports status, diffs, branches, add/stage, unstage, discard, commit, log, fetch, pull, push, and stash workflows. The interactive menus guide selection; remote and destructive actions require confirmation.

## Models and authentication

The model's API protocol determines the environment variables used for its API key, base URL, and optional model override:

| Protocol | API key | Base URL | Model override |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI-compatible completions | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `OPENAI_MODEL` |
| Anthropic Messages | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` |
| Google Generative AI | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `GEMINI_BASE_URL` | `GEMINI_MODEL` |
| Fallback | `API_KEY` | `BASE_URL` | `MODEL` |

Provider sign-in is also available through `/login`; use `/auth` to inspect authentication status. Built-in models and authentication methods are sourced from the pinned Pi packages. To see the catalog available in your build, run `microcode model list`.

### Custom models

Add models to `~/.microcode/config.json` for your user account or `.microcode/config.json` for the current project. Project definitions take precedence over user definitions with the same ID.

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "my-model",
      "name": "My Model",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com/v1",
      "apiKeyEnv": "MY_API_KEY",
      "reasoning": false,
      "input": ["text"],
      "contextWindow": 128000,
      "maxTokens": 4096
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported `api` values are `openai-completions`, `anthropic-messages`, and `google-generative-ai`. Optional fields include `apiKeyEnv`, `reasoning`, `thinkingFormat`, `input` (for example, `["text", "image"]`), `headers`, and display-only `cost`. Custom models are available in `/model` and `microcode model list`.

See [the model integration and gateway spec](docs/specs/model_intergration_spec.md) for the model catalog, authentication, direct integration, and harness-independent gateway design.

## Model gateway

By default, `microcode` starts or reuses a per-user loopback Model Gateway, performs a health/model-list/private-RPC handshake, and routes model generation through it. A successful handshake prints the protocol version and model count. If startup or the handshake fails, Microcode prints the failure and explicitly falls back to the existing direct, in-process Pi path for that session. Use `microcode --no-daemon` to select that path intentionally. The gateway is an inference service; external harnesses continue to own their tools, approvals, prompts, and sessions.

The initial service listens on `127.0.0.1:43127`. Host and port can be configured independently. For each setting, precedence is command-line option, environment variable, `~/.microcode/config.json`, then the default:

| Setting | CLI | Environment | User config | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bind address | `--gateway-host <HOST>` | `MICROCODE_GATEWAY_HOST` | `gateway.host` | `127.0.0.1` |
| Port | `--gateway-port <PORT>` | `MICROCODE_GATEWAY_PORT` | `gateway.port` | `43127` |

The host must be an IP address or hostname without a scheme or port. Use `127.0.0.1` for this computer only, a specific local address such as `192.168.1.20` to listen on one interface, or `0.0.0.0` to listen on all IPv4 interfaces. For a persistent user-level configuration, merge this top-level section into `~/.microcode/config.json` (preserve any existing settings):

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 43127
  }
}
```

For a one-time bind-address override, start with `microcode gateway start --gateway-host 0.0.0.0`. In the TUI, `/gateway` opens the address picker; `/gateway 192.168.1.20` sets an address directly. Changing the address persists `gateway.host`, restarts the daemon, and checks the handshake. A specific address must be assigned to this machine. If a daemon is already running on another address or port, Microcode reports the conflict and does not replace it silently. Gateway state and owner-only tokens are stored under `~/.microcode/daemon/`.

For a persistent private-network listener, set `"host": "0.0.0.0"` in the JSON above (or set `MICROCODE_GATEWAY_HOST=0.0.0.0`) and keep the port restricted to trusted clients with the server firewall.

```bash
microcode gateway status
microcode gateway start
microcode gateway token  # explicitly prints the client token
microcode gateway token --rotate  # rotate while stopped, then print the new client token
microcode gateway stop
```

The service exposes `GET /v1/models`, OpenAI Chat Completions at `/v1/chat/completions`, OpenAI Responses at `/v1/responses`, and Anthropic Messages at `/v1/messages`. Use the printed gateway token as Bearer auth for OpenAI-compatible clients or `x-api-key` for Anthropic-compatible clients. Model IDs use `provider/model` from `/v1/models`. The public token is separate from upstream provider credentials and the private TUI RPC token. Stop the gateway before rotating the public token; rotation refuses to invalidate credentials used by a running daemon.

### Use Microcode as a local or private-network API relay

The gateway separates upstream model authentication from client authentication:

1. Sign in to the model provider in Microcode with `/login <provider>` (or configure that provider's API-key environment variable). The gateway uses these Microcode-managed credentials for upstream requests; client applications do not receive them.
2. Start the persistent service with `microcode gateway start` and check it with `microcode gateway status`. It stays available after the TUI exits. It is loopback-only by default. To make it reachable from another machine on a trusted network, bind all IPv4 interfaces (or just the server's LAN address):

   ```bash
   microcode gateway start --gateway-host 0.0.0.0
   # or: microcode gateway start --gateway-host 192.168.1.20
   ```

   Then use the server's reachable address—not `0.0.0.0`—in remote client URLs, for example `http://192.168.1.20:43127`. Allow the port only on the intended private network in the host firewall.
3. Read the client token with `microcode gateway token`. Treat it as a secret. Find an exact model ID with the authenticated `GET /v1/models` endpoint; use its `id` value (usually `provider/model`) in requests.

```bash
export MICROCODE_GATEWAY_TOKEN="$(microcode gateway token)"
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:43127/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MICROCODE_GATEWAY_TOKEN"
```

For example, after setting `MICROCODE_GATEWAY_TOKEN` to the token printed by `microcode gateway token`, the OpenAI Python SDK can call the gateway's Chat Completions endpoint:

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:43127/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["MICROCODE_GATEWAY_TOKEN"],
)

result = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro",  # Replace with an id from GET /v1/models.
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain what a reverse proxy does in one sentence."}],
)
print(result.choices[0].message.content)
```

The Anthropic Python SDK can use the Anthropic Messages endpoint in the same way. Its `api_key` here is the **Microcode gateway token**, not an Anthropic API key:

```python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:43127",
    api_key=os.environ["MICROCODE_GATEWAY_TOKEN"],
)

message = client.messages.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",  # Replace with an id from GET /v1/models.
    max_tokens=256,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain what a reverse proxy does in one sentence."}],
)
for block in message.content:
    if block.type == "text":
        print(block.text)
```

Install the corresponding SDK in your Python environment (`pip install openai` or `pip install anthropic`). For a client on another machine, replace `127.0.0.1` in the examples with the gateway server's reachable LAN address; OpenAI uses a base URL ending in `/v1`, while Anthropic uses the gateway origin. The endpoint dialect is selected by the SDK route; the chosen upstream model must support the requested capabilities, and unsupported protocol options are rejected rather than silently translated.

**Public-network security:** binding to `0.0.0.0` only opens a listener; it does not add TLS, per-client identities/tokens, rate limits, quotas, or multi-tenant isolation. The current gateway has one shared client token. Do not expose its port directly to the public Internet. For remote use, put it behind a separately secured VPN or TLS/reverse-proxy layer, restrict inbound network access, and protect/rotate the gateway token. Do not assume a vendor's consumer subscription permits API relaying; use only provider authorization and inference flows explicitly supported for that use.

These endpoints are protocol adapters under active development. Passing Microcode's fake-runtime contract tests does not by itself certify a specific Codex, Claude Code, or DeepSeek client/version; consult the spec for current compatibility gates and known unsupported request options. The gateway does not execute client tools or expose Microcode workspace tools.

## Skills, plugins, and project instructions

### Skills

Skills are directories containing a `SKILL.md` file. Microcode discovers:

- User Skills in `~/.microcode/skills/`
- Project Skills in `.microcode/skills/`
- Built-in Skills managed by Microcode

Project Skills take precedence over user Skills with the same name; built-in names are reserved. Type `$` to browse available Skills, then select one. Plugin Skills use the namespaced form `$plugin-name:skill-name`. A Skill adds instructions to that request; it does not grant additional tool permissions.

### Plugins

Microcode plugins are packages that can bundle Skills and MCP server definitions. They are discovered from:

- User: `~/.microcode/plugins/<plugin-name>/`
- Project: `.microcode/plugins/<plugin-name>/`

A package has a `plugin.json` manifest and may include a `skills/` directory and/or an `mcp.json` file. For example:

```text
my-plugin/
├── plugin.json
├── mcp.json          # optional
└── skills/           # optional
    └── review/
        └── SKILL.md
```

The required manifest fields are `name` (lowercase kebab-case), `version` (semantic version), and `description`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A short description of this package"
}
```

Use `/plugins` to inspect the list and choose which plugins are enabled in each scope. Packages are disabled unless enabled in Microcode. Only the documented package components are loaded; plugin manifests do not run arbitrary hooks or commands. Plugin Skills and MCP servers are namespaced, and plugin-provided MCP servers are connected when their plugin is enabled.

### Project instructions

Microcode loads `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `MICRO.md` files from the project root down to the current working directory, subject to a combined size limit. `/instructions` shows the loaded files; `/instructions reload` discovers them again. `/init` proposes a `MICRO.md` guide and asks before applying it.

## MCP servers

Standalone MCP configuration can live in `~/.microcode/config.json` or `.microcode/config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Directory packages are also supported: put an `mcp.json` containing an `mcpServers` object under `~/.microcode/mcp/<package>/` or `.microcode/mcp/<package>/`. Supported transports include local stdio and secure remote MCP endpoints. Microcode discovers and connects configured servers at startup; `/mcp` shows runtime status and `microcode mcp list` lists discovered configuration. MCP tools still follow Microcode's permission policy. MCP `env` and `headers` values are stored as configuration strings: keep credentials in local, untracked configuration and do not commit them.

## Permissions

The default `interactive` mode allows reads and asks before write, edit, and shell operations. Set a mode at launch with `--permission` (or `--permission-mode`) or change it with `/permission`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `interactive` | Ask before write/edit/shell operations |
| `auto-approve` | Run tools without interactive approval prompts |
| `plan` | Read-only; block write, edit, and shell operations |

Review tool requests and permission prompts before approving them, especially when using external MCP servers.

## Sessions

Sessions are stored locally under `~/.microcode/sessions/`. `microcode --resume` opens the latest session for the current working directory; `microcode --resume <id-prefix>` opens a matching session. Resumed messages are rendered in the conversation immediately and can be browsed with the mouse wheel or PageUp/PageDown. Use `/session` to choose from saved sessions or `/new` to begin another conversation.

## Release packages

The CLI/TUI package scripts are in `packaging/`:

```bash
bun run package:cli
```

Artifacts are written to `packaging/out/` as platform-specific `.tar.gz` (Linux/macOS) or `.zip` (Windows) packages. Build on each target operating system for a native executable. See [packaging/README.md](packaging/README.md) for install details.
